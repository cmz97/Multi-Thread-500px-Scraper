## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)


### Built With

* [Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)
* [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* Selenium Python
```sh
pip install selenium
```

* geckodriver
[Get latest releases](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. Firefox, for example, requires geckodriver, which needs to be installed before the below examples can be run. Make sure it’s in your PATH, e. g., place it in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin. Failure to observe this step will give you an error selenium.common.exceptions.WebDriverException: Message: ‘geckodriver’ executable needs to be in PATH.

* Python Image Library
```sh
pip install Pillow
```


### Installation

1. Clone the Multi-Thread-500px-Scraper
